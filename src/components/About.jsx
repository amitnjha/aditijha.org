								<p className={"text-center"}>
My dad started building  this website which encouraged me to add all the cool features like I ever wanted in my own website. Blue is my favourite color and I am planning to use different shades of blue and turquoise on the website. I am 8 right now but will soon turn 9 in July. I love reading fiction on mysteries and fantasies and sometimes fact based non-fiction as well.

My brother is 4 and its so much fun playing with him on trampoline. The weather is good as its spring now and I get to spend more time outside in nature. I wish I could visit the zoo, but with COVID 19, we are restraining ourselves at home. We used to have barbeque in our neighbourhood every summer and I would enjoy the sweet treats like marshmallow and donuts. I hope all this gets better and we are back to normal. 

I am fond of music and like listening to songs or compose my own lyrics sometimes. I like art and craft activities and love creating new masterpiece out of blocks or legos.
I am not sure what I want to be when I grow up, probably I will figure out gradually. My friends and I have made a lot of craft work and I am planning to make an online store on this website.</p>
